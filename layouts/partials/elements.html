                                        <p>I often recall one sunset in a riverside pavilion. <br>
                                            Having drunk too much, I forgot the way home. <br>
                                            Knowing it was late, I started back in my boat at dusk <br>
                                            but paddled by mistake into a thick patch of lotuses. <br>
                                            Struggling to get out, <br>
                                            struggling to get out, <br>
                                            I startled a whole sandbar of egrets into flight. <br>

                                            Last night the rain was intermittent, the wind blustery. <br>
                                            Deep sleep did not dispel the lingering wine. <br>
                                            I tried asking the maid raising the blinds, <br>
                                            who said the crab-apple blossoms were as before. <br>
                                            “Don’t you know? <br>
                                            Don’t you know? <br>
                                            The greens must be plump and the reds spindly.” <br>

                                        <p> A small courtyard and lattice window, the spring colors are vivid. <br>
                                            The double blinds are not lifted, shadows gather deep inside. <br>
                                            She leans on the balcony, saying nothing, plucking a pearled zither. <br>

                                            A distant cave emits clouds, hurrying the onset of dusk, <br>
                                            a light wind brings rain, rippling the sparse shade. <br>
                                            The pear blossoms will soon wither—no preventing it, I fear. <br>

                                            One type of longing, <br>
                                            idle sadness in two places. <br>

                                        Drunk last night, I delayed taking off my make-up. <br>
                                        A withered sprig of plum blossoms still sits in my hair. <br>
                                        Sobering up now, their scent interrupts my spring sleep, <br>
                                        my distant dream did not carry me home. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        No sounds of people now, <br>
                                        the moon hangs longingly in the sky.<br>
                                        The green blinds are lowered.<br>
                                        Again, I toy with the fading flowers,<br>
                                        pinching out, again, what fragrance remains,<br>
                                        to make it last, again, a little longer.<br>
                                    </p>

                                        Searching, hunting, seeking, looking, <br>
                                        so chilly and yet so clear. <br>
                                        distressed, dismal, and forlorn. <br>
                                        Warm awhile then cold again, it’s that season, <br>
                                        the worst for taking care of yourself. <br>
                                        How can two or three cups of weak wine <br>
                                        hold up against<br>
                                        the strength of the evening wind?<br>
                                        The wild geese have flown past,<br>
                                        truly saddening the heart,<br>
                                        what’s more, I recognize them from years past.<br>
                                        Yellow petals cover the ground, strewn in piles.<br>
                                        I’m so haggard and weakened now,<br>
                                        who bothers to pluck them anymore before they fall?<br>
                                        I sit beside the window, all by myself,<br>
                                        how could it have turned so black outside?<br>
                                        Paulownia trees and fine rain,<br>
                                        until dusk has fallen, I listen to<br>
                                        drip after drip, drop after drop.<br>
                                        This scene, this feeling—<br>
                                        how could the word “sorrow” ever suffice?<br>

                                        I’d like to go boating in a light skiff.<br>
