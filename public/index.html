                                    The "Thousand Character Text" is a famous Chinese poem utilized as a primer for young children to learn Chinese characters. It is likely that Li's original collection included a manuscript of the literary poem.

                                            The double blinds are not lifted, shadows gather deep inside. <br>
                                            She leans on the balcony, saying nothing, plucking a pearled zither. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            A distant cave emits clouds, hurrying the onset of dusk, <br>
                                            a light wind brings rain, rippling the sparse shade. <br>
                                            The pear blossoms will soon wither—no preventing it, I fear. <br>

                                            The scent of red lotuses fades in jade mat autumn. <br>
                                            Lightly she unties her gauze robe <br>
                                            to board the magnolia boat alone. <br>
                                            Amid the clouds, who sends a brocade letter? <br>
                                            As the wild geese character comes back1 <br>
                                            moonlight fills the western tower. <br>

                                            Blossoms fall on their own, the water flows by itself. <br>
                                            One type of longing, <br>
                                            idle sadness in two places. <br>
                                            There’s no means to get rid of this feeling. <br>

                                        Drunk last night, I delayed taking off my make-up. <br>
                                        A withered sprig of plum blossoms still sits in my hair. <br>
                                        Sobering up now, their scent interrupts my spring sleep, <br>
                                        my distant dream did not carry me home. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        No sounds of people now, <br>
                                        the moon hangs longingly in the sky.<br>
                                        The green blinds are lowered.<br>
                                        Again, I toy with the fading flowers,<br>
                                        pinching out, again, what fragrance remains,<br>
                                        to make it last, again, a little longer.<br>

                                        so chilly and yet so clear. <br>
                                        distressed, dismal, and forlorn. <br>
                                        Warm awhile then cold again, it’s that season, <br>

                                        Yellow petals cover the ground, strewn in piles.<br>
                                        I’m so haggard and weakened now,<br>
                                        who bothers to pluck them anymore before they fall?<br>

                                        風住塵香花已盡 <br>
                                        日晚倦梳頭。<br>
                                        物是人非事事休。<br>
                                        欲語淚先流。<br>
                                        <br>
                                        聞說雙溪春尚好<br>
                                        也擬泛輕舟。<br>
                                        只恐雙溪舴艋舟。<br>
                                        載不動<br>
                                        許多愁。<br>
                                    </p>

                                        When the winds stop, the ground is fragrant, the flowers all are down,<br>
                                        as the day wears on I’m too lazy to comb my hair.<br>
                                        The objects are right, the people wrong, everything is over now!<br>
                                        About to speak, tears first flow.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        I’ve heard spring is still lovely at Twin Streams,<br>
                                        I’d like to go boating in a light skiff.<br>
                                        But I fear the little grasshopper boats they have<br>
                                        could not carry<br>
                                        such a freight of sorrow.<br>
                                    </p>
